Your task is to inspect a conversation between a **student** and a **teacher**.

Evaluate the **style and appropriateness** of the teacher's messages, ensuring the conversation is realistic, natural, and educationally effective.

---

### **Acceptable Teacher Style**:
- Messages are concise and easy to understand.
- Teacher patiently and respectfully engages the student.
- **Most of the talking is done by the student**, with the teacher primarily responding or briefly clarifying.
- Conversation feels natural and believable (e.g., conversational tone, realistic student-teacher interaction).

### **You must REJECT the conversation if any of these occur**:
- **Overly Long Messages**:  
  Teacher messages that are excessively long, detailed, or overwhelming with unnecessary information.  
  *(Example: Teacher sends multiple paragraphs of explanation when a brief, clear sentence would suffice.)*

- **Teacher Dominates Conversation**:  
  The teacher speaks significantly more than the student or overly controls the conversation.  
  *(Example: Teacher repeatedly interrupts or unnecessarily elaborates when the student could continue.)*

- **Language Mixing/Switching**:  
  The conversation must remain entirely in **English**. Switching or mixing languages‚Äîeven briefly‚Äîis not allowed.  
  *(Example: Teacher says something partially or completely in Spanish.)*

- **Unrealistic/Unnatural Interaction**:  
  Conversation doesn't feel believable between a real teacher and student (awkward phrasing, unnatural dialogue, abrupt changes in tone).  
  *(Example: Student abruptly discusses unrelated personal issues mid-explanation.)*

- **Incomplete or Empty**:  
  Teacher sends incomplete, empty, or abruptly cut-off messages.  
  *(Example: Teacher's message suddenly ends mid-sentence.)*

## üìù **Examples:**

### **Good Example (OK)**:
- Student: I don‚Äôt get the second step of this solution.
- Teacher: Could you tell me exactly which part confuses you?
- Student: It's the part where you simplify the fraction.
- Teacher: Sure! Let's focus on that simplification. Do you remember how we reduce fractions?

### **Bad Example (REJECT - Overly Long)**:
- Student: I‚Äôm confused about simplifying fractions.
- Teacher: Simplifying fractions involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and dividing both by it. For example, if you have 12/16, the greatest common divisor is 4, so dividing numerator and denominator by 4 gives you 3/4. Another example is 10/20; the GCD here is 10, so this reduces to 1/2. You must always look carefully to identify the largest divisor...

*(Reason: Excessively long and detailed explanation.)*

### **Bad Example (REJECT - Language Mixing)**:
- Student: Should I divide both sides next?
- Teacher: Yes, exactly! Divide ambos lados por dos.

*(Reason: Mixing English and Spanish.)*
